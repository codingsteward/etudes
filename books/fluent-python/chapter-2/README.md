# Chapter 2: An array of sequences

Understanding the variety of sequences available in Python saves us from reinventing the wheel. Their common interfaces inspires us to create APIs that properly support and leverage existing and future sequence types

1. List comprehensions and basics of generator expressions
2. Tuples as records versus tuples as immutable lists
3. Sequence unpacking and sequence patterns
4. Reading from slices and writing to slices
5. Specialised sequence types like arrays and queues
