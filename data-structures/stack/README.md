# Stack

In a stack, the element deleted from the set is the one most recently inserted: last-in, first-out or LIFO policy. 

## Operations

1. Push(s, x), pop(s)
2. empty(s)


[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
^ 

## Knowledge
Implement a stack
1. pop(), push(item), peek(), isEmpty()



## CtCi

1. Use a single array to implement 3 stacks
2. Design a stack with additional min function which returns minimum element
3. Stack of plates. If a stack gets too high, it topples. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks which creates a new stack once previous one exceed capacity. The push and pop operations should behave identically as a single stack
    - Implement popAt(index) to pop at a specific substack
4. Implement a queue using two stacks
5. Sort stack. You can use additional temporary stack but not other data structure
6. Given arithmetic equation consisting of positive integers, +, -, \*, \/, compute the result i.e calculator
7. 


## EPI

1. Implement a stack with max API
2. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
3. Check if a string of parentheses is well-formed
4. Normalize pathnames by returning shortest equivalent pathname
5. Compute buildings with a sunset view (from both directions)

## Skiena

1. Check if properly nested parentheses and balanced. Identify position of first offending parenthesis.
2. Give a string of parenthesis, find length of longest balanced parentheses.
3. Design a stack with findMin() which returns minimum element of stack
