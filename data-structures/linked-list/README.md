# Linked list

## Singly linked list
Linked list is either empty or contains data item and a link to the next node.


## Doubly linked list
Doubly linked list is similar to a linked list with an addition back pointer "prev" to point to the previous node. This allows the doubly linked list to traverse forward and backward.
